# Factorio-Tag-To-Teleport
Factorio mod that adds a simple teleporation option

# Description

Place a teleportation tag on the map to travel there instantly. Give it a name and you can fast travel there with a keyboard shortcut! No costs, perfect for the end-game when you got tired of running and travelling by trains.

# How to use it

Place a tag with no name to teleport to that location.

To save a teleportation location for later use, give it a name that starts with a digit. You can name it e.g. '1 Refinery', '2: Iron', '3 - Train Station' or just '4'.

Default controls to teleport to saved locations: CTRL + [0-9]
